# mb2-display: MicroBit 2 Rust demo of Adafruit TFT display
Bart Massey 2023

This crate is a demo of using the Adafruit
[3533](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3533) TFT display
from Rust on the MicroBit v2.

The demo draws a green circle with a blue border against a
white background at the center of the display.

## Wiring

This display was tested on a breadboard plugged into the
Adafruit
[DragonTail](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3695). It was
wired as follows:

| Display Pin | Connection | MB2 Pin |
|------------:|:----------:|:--------|
|         Vin | 3.3V (+)   |         |
|          3V | NC         |         |
|         GND | Gnd (-)    |         |
|         SCK | P13        | p0.17   |
|        MISO | NC         |         |
|        MOSI | P15        | p0.13   |
|       TFTCS | Gnd (-)    |         |
|         RST | P9         | p0.09   |
|          DC | P8         | p0.10   |
|        SDCS | NC         |         |
|         LIT | NC         |         |

Here, "NC" is "no connection", "P" numbers refer to Dragon
Tail pins, "p" numbers refer to internal GPIO numbering.

Because TFTCS is hard-wired on (active low), and SDCS is not
connected and floats off, only the display can be accessed
in this configuration â€” the SD card cannot. The MISO line is
also left unconnected; this is used only for SD card
reads. Finally, the LIT line is not connected and floats on;
this could be used to PWM or turn off the display backlight
if desired.

## Build and Run

You'll need Rust and some embedded tools installed to try
this. Install [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/), then start with
these commands (as needed).

    rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
    rustup component add llvm-tools
    cargo install cargo-binutils
    cargo install probe-run
    cargo install cargo-embed

Finally, power up your wired-up MB2 and say

    cargo embed --release
